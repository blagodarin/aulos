**aulos** is an audio synthesis toolkit.

Key concepts:
* Fully synthetic sound ("vector audio" as a counterpart to vector graphics).
* Suitable for realtime audio generation in performance-demanding applications (e. g. games).
* Easy to integrate into existing codebases (as a static library with no external dependencies).
* Provides a basic set of tools for audio playback and editing.
