# aulos

**aulos** is an audio synthesis toolkit.

Key concepts:
* Fully synthetic sound ("vector audio" as a counterpart to vector graphics).
* Suitable for realtime audio generation in performance-demanding applications (e. g. games).
* Easy to integrate into existing codebases (as a static library which only depends on the C++ standard library).
* Includes a full-featured utility for audio creation, editing and playback.


## Disclaimer

**aulos** is in its early stages of development. Until it reaches version 0.1,
*any* commit may change *anything* (API, ABI, file format) in an incompatible way.
